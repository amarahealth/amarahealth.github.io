    <h1>Women’s health, supported with clarity and care.</h1>

    <p>
      Amara Health is a women’s health and wellness platform supporting
      prenatal journeys, postnatal recovery, and hormonal conditions like
      PCOS and PCOD.
    </p>

    <p>
      We bring together safe movement, nutrition and mental wellbeing —
      guided by female specialists, delivered with consistency, not noise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PRENATAL -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container block">
      <h2>Prenatal support</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        Pregnancy often comes with uncertainty about what is safe, what helps,
        and what should be avoided.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our prenatal programs provide structured guidance through
        female physiotherapists who support pregnancy-appropriate exercises
        at the comfort of your home — daily, alternate days, or fully customised.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nutrition support from dieticians or nutritionists, mental wellbeing
        coaching, and specialised counselling such as lactation support
        can be integrated as needed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- POSTNATAL -->
  <section>
    <div class="container block soft-card">
      <h2>Postnatal recovery</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        Postnatal recovery is not just about returning to routine.
        It is about allowing the body and mind the time and support to heal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our female therapists support recovery through guided movement at home,
        focusing on rebuilding strength, restoring stability, and easing the
        physical and emotional load of the postnatal phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nutrition and mental wellbeing support are part of the same journey —
        because recovery is never only physical.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- PCOS -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container block">
      <h2>PCOS & PCOD support</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        PCOS and PCOD do not have a single permanent cure.
        They require long-term lifestyle changes that are realistic
        and sustainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our structured programs support women over a focused period
        to build habits around movement, nutrition and stress management,
        guided by female therapists and nutrition specialists.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not short-term results, but lasting shifts that women
        can continue independently over time.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- FUTURE -->
  <section>
    <div class="container block soft-card">
      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
      <div class="divider"></div>

      <p>
        In the future, Amara Health will also offer online training,
        guided routines and coaching for women who may not be able
        to access in-person support immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are building this carefully, with safety, trust and evidence
        at the centre.
